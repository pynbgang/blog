|| 
|| Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
|| 
|| Example 1:
|| 
|| 
|| Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
|| Output: [2,2]
|| 
|| 
|| 
|| Example 2:
|| 
|| 
|| Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
|| Output: [4,9]
|| 
|| 
|| Note:
|| 
|| 
|| 	Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
|| 	The result can be in any order.
|| 
|| 
|| Follow up:
|| 
|| 
|| 	What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
|| 	What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
|| 	What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
