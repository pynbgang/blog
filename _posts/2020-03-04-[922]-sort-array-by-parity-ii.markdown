    || 
    || Given an array AÂ of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.
    || 
    || Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.
    || 
    || You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
    || 
    || Example 1:
    || Input: [4,2,5,7]
    || Output: [4,5,2,7]
    || Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
    || 
    || Note:
    || 
    || 
    || 	2 <= A.length <= 20000
    || 	A.length % 2 == 0
    || 	0 <= A[i] <= 1000
