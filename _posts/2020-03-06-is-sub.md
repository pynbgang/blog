# [[989] Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

    || Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    ||                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    || You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).                                                                                               
    ||                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    || A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
