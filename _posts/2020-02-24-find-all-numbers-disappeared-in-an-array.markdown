|| 
|| Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
|| 
|| Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
|| 
|| Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
|| 
|| Example:
|| 
|| Input:
|| [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
|| 
|| Output:
|| [5,6]
