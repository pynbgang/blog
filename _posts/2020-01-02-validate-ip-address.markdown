# [validate-ip-address](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/validate-ip-address/description)

IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal
notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging
from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."), e.g.,172.16.254.1;

Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the
address 172.16.254.01 is invalid.

IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four
hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups
are separated by colons (":"). For example, the address
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid one. Also, we
could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and
some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so
2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6
address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).

However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with
a single empty group using two consecutive colons ("::") to
pursue simplicity. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334
is an invalid IPv6 address.

Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For
example, the address 02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is
invalid.

## notes

v4:

* 4 decimal nums, each ranging from 0-255, separated by ".", e.g.,172.16.254.1
* leading zeros is invalid. For example, 172.16.254.01 is invalid.

v6:

* 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. 
* groups are separated by ":". e.g.: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
* omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits
* some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones: e.g: 
  - 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is valid
* extra leading zeros is invalid. e.g. 02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

## jj1 update
```python

            #    it has to be a digit that is not gt 255
            #    no leading zero, except for 0

            #   it has to be no more than 4 chars
            #   char has to be in the allowed char set

                all([

                ]):
                return "IPv6"
        return "Neither"
```

## jj2 (best)

```python
def validIPAddress(self, IP):
    # Write your code here
    if IP.count(".") == 3 \
        and all([
            s.isnumeric() and int(s) <= 255
            and (len(s) == 1 or s[0] != "0")
            for s in IP.split(".")
        ]):
        return "IPv4"
    hexnums = "0123456789abcdefABCDEF"
    if IP.count(":") == 7 \
        and all([
            all([c in hexnums for c in s])
            and len(s) <= 4
            for s in IP.split(":")
        ]):
        return "IPv6"
    return "Neither"
```

* save temp var: `for s in IP.split`
* `x or y` instead of `expr if else`
* ...
