    || 
    || According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply
    || as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
    || Horton Conway in 1970."
    || 
    || Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
    || dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal,
    || vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above
    || Wikipedia article):
    || 
    || 
    || Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
    || under-population.
    || Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
    || generation.
    || Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
    || over-population..
    || Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if
    || by reproduction.
    || 
    || 
    || Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
    || given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above
    || rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and
    || deaths occur simultaneously.
    || 
    || Example:
    || 
    || 
    || Input: 
    || [
    ||   [0,1,0],
    ||   [0,0,1],
    ||   [1,1,1],
    ||   [0,0,0]
    || ]
    || Output: 
    || [
    ||   [0,0,0],
    ||   [1,0,1],
    ||   [0,1,1],
    ||   [0,1,0]
    || ]
    || 
    || Follow up:
    || 
    || 	Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
    || 	In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

extend the scale of matrix to +2 and +2

```python
class Solution(object):
    def gameOfLife(self, board):
        row, col=len(board), len(board[0])
        l1=[[0 for x in range(col+2)] for y in range(row+2)]
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                if board[i][j]==1: l1[i+1][j+1]=1
        for i in range(1,row+1):
            for j in range(1,col+1):
                temp=self.helper(l1,i,j)
                if l1[i][j]==1:
                    if temp<2:board[i-1][j-1]=0
                    elif 2<=temp<=3:board[i-1][j-1]=1
                    else:board[i-1][j-1]=0
                else:
                    if temp==3:board[i-1][j-1]=1
        return board
    def helper(self,l1,i,j):
        return l1[i-1][j-1]+l1[i+1][j+1]+l1[i-1][j+1]+l1[i+1][j-1]+l1[i][j-1]+l1[i-1][j]+l1[i][j+1]+l1[i+1][j]
```

## JJ

```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        offset, r, c = [[i, j] for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2) if i or j], len(board), len(board[0])
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                nei = sum([board[i + oi][j + oj] > 0 for oi, oj in offset if i + oi in range(r) and j + oj in range(c)])
                board[i][j] += nei if board[i][j] else - nei
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                board[i][j] = 1 * (board[i][j] in (-3, 3, 4))
```

## ping: dict w/ complex as key, 6 lines, urly

```python
class Solution(object):     # ping: use dict, borrow idea from 695 zb code
    def gameOfLife(self, grid):           #use a dict to record grid and value
        d = {i + j*1j: val for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, val in enumerate(row)}
        for i in range(len(grid)):        #each node get it's 8-neighbors sum
            for j in range(len(grid[0])): #then flip based on rules
                sum1 = (sum(d.get(i+j*1j+1j**k, 0) for k in range(4)) + # +
                        d.get(i+1+j*1j+1j, 0) + d.get(i-1+j*1j-1j, 0) + # x
                        d.get(i+1+j*1j-1j, 0) + d.get(i-1+j*1j+1j, 0))
                if (d.get(i+j*1j,0) and not 2<=sum1<=3) or (not d.get(i+j*1j,0) and sum1==3):
                    grid[i][j] = int(not(grid[i][j]))   #flip 0/1
```

## ping: dict + offset, 7 lines, readable

drop 'complex', use offset idea from jj (more readable), +1 line but better

```python
class Solution(object):     # ping: dict + offset (from jj)
    def gameOfLife(self, grid):
        # use a dict to record board info, a tupple list to record offset
        d = {(i, j): val for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, val in enumerate(row)}
        o = [(i, j) for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2) if i or j]
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                sum1 = sum(d.get((i+oi, j+oj), 0) for oi, oj in o)
                if (d.get((i, j)) and not 2<=sum1<=3) or (not d.get((i,j)) and sum1==3):
                    grid[i][j] = 1 - grid[i][j]         #flip 0/1
```
