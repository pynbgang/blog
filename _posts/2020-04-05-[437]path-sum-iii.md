    || You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
    || 
    || Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.
    || 
    || The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
    || (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
    || 
    || The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.
    || 
    || Example:
    || 
    || root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8
    || root = [5,3,2,3,-2,1], sum = 8
    || 
    || ⁠     10
    || ⁠    /  \
    || ⁠   5   -3
    || ⁠  / \    \
    || ⁠ 3   2   11
    || ⁠/ \   \
    || 3  -2   1
    || 
    || Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:
    || 
    || 1.  5 -> 3
    || 2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
    || 3. -3 -> 11

## owen 

double helper fun,can not return even the sum is matching ,have to go to bottom

```python
class Solution(object):
    def pathSum(self, root, sum):
        if not root:return 0
        self.count=0
        self.helper1(root,sum)
        return self.count
    def helper1(self,root,sum):
        if not root:return
        self.helper2(root,sum)
        self.helper1(root.left,sum)
        self.helper1(root.right,sum)
    def helper2(self,root,sum):
        if not root:return
        if root.val == sum:
            self.count+=1
        if root.left:self.helper2(root.left,sum-root.val)
        if root.right:self.helper2(root.right,sum-root.val)
```

## lmv

```python
class Solution(object):         #lmv
    def pathSum(self, root, s):
        return self.helper(root, s, [s])

    def helper(self, node, origin, targets):
        "node: each node in tree
        "origin: original target: ex. sum 8
        "targets: added each diff as new target after comparing each node to sum8

        if not node: return 0   #when hit leaves, return
        hit = 0                 #init result
        for t in targets:       #compare current node val with all targets
            if not t-node.val: hit += 1     # if same, count, else, add diff
        targets = [t-node.val for t in targets]+[origin]  # as new target
        return (hit +                                     # repeat for each
                self.helper(node.left, origin, targets) + # left tree and
                self.helper(node.right, origin, targets)  # right tree
                )                                         # and add up results
```

## lmv: add debug to illustrate

```python

            self.spaces-=4
            msg = "| no more node, return..."
            print(' '*self.spaces+msg, sep='')
            return 0
        else:

            print(' '*self.spaces+msg, sep='')
        hit = 0

            print(' '*self.spaces+msg, sep='')
            if not t-node.val:
                hit += 1                  # count if sum == target
                msg="| node val " + str(node.val) + " match " + str(t) + " hit:" + str(hit)
                print(' '*self.spaces+msg, sep='')

                print(' '*self.spaces+msg, sep='')
        targets = [t-node.val for t in targets]+[origin] # update the targets
        msg="| update targets: " + str(targets)
        print(' '*self.spaces+msg, sep='')
        return (hit +
                self.helper(node.left, origin, targets) +
                self.helper(node.right, origin, targets)
                )
