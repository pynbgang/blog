    || 
    || You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,
    and S representing the stones you have.Â  Each character in S is a type of
    stone you have.Â  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also
    jewels.
    || 
    || The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S
    are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different
    type of stone from "A".
    || 
    || Example 1:
    || 
    || Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
    || Output: 3
    || 
    || Example 2:
    || 
    || Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
    || Output: 0
    || 
    || Note:
    || 
    || 	S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
    || 	The characters in J are distinct.

    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        return sum(S.count(j) for j in set(J))
