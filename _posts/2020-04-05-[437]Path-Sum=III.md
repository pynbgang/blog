# [[437] Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

    ||You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.                                                                
    ||                                                                                                                                         
    ||Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.                                                                                      
    ||                                                                                                                                         
    ||The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
    ||                                                                                                                                         
    ||The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.
