    || 
    || Given an array with n integers, your task is to check if it could become
    non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.
    || 
    || We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i]  holds for every i (1 
    || 
    || Example 1:
    || 
    || Input: [4,2,3]
    || Output: True
    || Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
    || 
    || Example 2:
    || 
    || Input: [4,2,1]
    || Output: False
    || Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
    || 
    || Note:
    || The n belongs to [1, 10,000].
